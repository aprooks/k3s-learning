# Tutorials and workbooks on K8s management

requirements:

* docker
* jupiter with IPython via anaconda or some hacky dind docker image with IPython.
* tested from mac only

Brief: K3s https://k3s.io/ is a lightweight K8s implementation which is suitable to run at micro machines and local docker. It's better than minicube or other dev single-node k8s since it allows you to test actual cluster management scenarios like nodes going up and down.
